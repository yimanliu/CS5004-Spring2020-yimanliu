Application that use MVC is not a good idea:

Cons of MVC: 
1. MVC framework can be complex since we need to divides the code into three part precisely. 

2. Developers need to maintain the consistency of these three parts in order to make the program work.

A two-tier or three-tier architecture can be a better framework for application like Chat Application, PDF generator.

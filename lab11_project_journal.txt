CS5004 Final project updates: 04/09/20

This week I learned how to apply Markov Chain Model to generate intelligent text.

The "text generator" is implemented in MarkovTextGeneratorLoL class. 
The basic idea is to train the input text, and I used LinkedList to store the input text.
In each Node of the LinkedList, it has Word, wordList (all next words after this word) filed. 
So here is how I store the text:

Assume I have a text: "hi there hi Yiman here it is"
then, here is what the LinkedList looks like:

hi -> there, Yiman
there -> hi
Yiman -> here
here -> it
it -> is
is -> hi

Thus, when I want to generate random text based on the text I have trained,
I could find the next word if I got a random start word (by getting the neighbor of the word)


Also, I kind of found how to decompose the program into MVC model. 
"Model" part is what I will mainly implement, it includes document.package, spelling.package and textgen.package
"Controller" will be MarkovController, EditDistanceController, and TextProController 
since different functionality may need different controller.
"View" part has actually been provided, it includes AutoSpellingTextArea.

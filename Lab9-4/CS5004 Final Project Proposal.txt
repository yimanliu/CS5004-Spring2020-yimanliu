CS5004 Final Project Proposal

Project: 
Implement a Text Editor with spelling checking, auto-completion and spelling suggestions in Java. Add the ability to measure text readability and performed Markov chain model to implement intelligent text generation.

Team member: 
Yiman Liu (I will complete this project by myself)

Reason to choose this project:
I found this project resource on 'Coursera'. It is taught by UC San Diego. I’m interested in this project because it not only applies the knowledge we learned before, like using Trie data structure to implement spelling checking and auto-completion, but also includes the knowledge that I want to learn in the future, like Markov chain model, which is used in many application, like natural language processing and speech recognition. Since I’m interested in machine learning, I think it might be a good start. 

What I expect to learn:
How to add functionality to text editor application?
How to integrate front-end and back-end program?
What is text readability? How to measure text readability?
How to generate random text using Markov chain model?

Good job on this Fractions Lab! Here is some feedback on things to keep in mind.

1. Great use of Javadoc comments.

2. In your toDouble method, complete the division first then cast into the double to eliminate additional work/processing time. 

3. Great job implementing the simplification before creating the string. You may want to consider adding the simplification to it's 
own method so it can be re-used in other areas.

4. Comparing doubles in Java can be tricky. Because it stores so many places out, sometimes the ending of it can hold garbage. You can 
use an assertEquals including a delta (percentage allowed to be off) or you can use cross multiplication to determine if they are equal.

5. In your equals method, you have already cast other into a Fraction. You would not need to do it again. You could instead use 
fraction.toDouble()

6. In your reciprocal method make sure you test the numerator for negative values. If you put a negative in your denominator your 
program will crash because a Fraction object cannot be created with a denominator less than 0.

7. Make sure you test your constructor method to ensure it throws the exception if an invalid denominator is provided.

8. Was your simplication method not working? Your toString method had the simplification but the test did not use that.

9. Make sure you test for all cases in each method. For example, your testEquals only tested for true. You need to also test for false.

10. In your reciprocal test, make sure you test to ensure your method is throwing the exception appropriately.
